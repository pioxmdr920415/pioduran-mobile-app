### Tools Created:

- List users: `python create_custom_admin.py --list`

✅ **API Registration Endpoint**
- Endpoint: `POST /api/auth/register`

Please test these admin accounts and tools from your end and let me know if you encounter any issues or require further adjustments. I am here to assist with deeper investigation or refinements if needed.
